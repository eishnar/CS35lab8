: After inserting 47 (but before rebalancing), the tree will look like this:

# TODO
    30
20      40
          50
        47
: At this point, the tree is out of balance at node 30 so we rotate 40.


: The resulting tree looks like this:

# TODO: write the post-balance tree here.
      40
  30      50
20      47

: Is the tree now balanced?  If not, perform the next rotation here.  Repeat until the tree is balanced.

#yes the tree is balanced.
